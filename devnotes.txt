    Upon looking for authentication solutions outside of JWTs, I ended up looking at them again because they 
    are so heavily used. I thought surely I was missing something. The thing that turned me away from them 
    was that there's nowhere to 100% securely store them on the frontend for persistant login sessions. After reading 
    around a lot I found this article to be a lot of help: 
        https://dev.to/gkoniaris/how-to-securely-store-jwt-tokens-51cf
    Reading through the article and the comments carefully I came to this conclusion. 
    The best way to use JWTs for authentication is to do everything I can to prevent XSS on my frontend. 
    Then, I really could either choose between localStorage or httpOnly cookies with strict samesite options.
    This would allow only my site to pull the JWT, and if my site is secure from XSS, then I should be secure.
    That's what I'm going to roll with for now (fingers crossed I won't need to refactor a lot from this)

    I've been using the MongoClient to connect my node server to my database, I think I should be using Mongoose. 
    I should switch to that and refactor my code into services

    I've split my codebase into services and implemented mongoose. Everything is looking way cleaner now! I think I'll 
    switch over to typescript before moving on. That's something I've been wanting to implement in an app.

    Scratch that, I'm going to start my react app, feel like going back into frontend right now
    Pretty much just scaffolded out the project, set up React-Router, and learned about good styling in React. 
    I'm going with CSS modules since it keeps styling very modular much like how Vue does it.
    Now I just need to figure out the correct way to override css module styles from parent components when necessary and 
    then I should have everything I need for styling in React.

    I think I've found the best way to override style in css modules when necessary. Passing css modules or even just 
    specific classNames through a prop that I'll call 'extraStyle' worked very well. This makes a lot of sense actually

    Another thing I found is that I should never use basic css selectors like 'h1' or 'div' even in a css module. It 
    will leak to other components. Always give things a specified className. I still very much like css modules with React

    I have an idea for an animation on the landing page, and I'm really tempted to make it right now... I should probably work 
    on something else but whatever I'm just going to do it.
